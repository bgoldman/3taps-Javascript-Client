 * @class The Posting API accepts incoming data in a standardized format that is then added to the posting database.
 * 
 * What is a Posting?
 * 
 * A posting is the central unit of data on which the 3taps Network operates. Each posting has:
 * 
 * A source, which is a 5-character code identifying where this posting came from.
 * 
 * A category, which is a 4-character code identifying the search category to associate with this posting. The category must be supplied.
 * 
 * A location, which is a 3-character code identifying the location at which this post resides. The location will generally be supplied, but is optional.
 * 
 * A latitude and longitude value, which are floating-point numbers representing the real or estimated GPS location for the posting, in decimal degrees.
 * 
 * A language, which is a two-letter code defining the language used by this posting. Note that the language code must conform to the ISO 639-1 standard.
 * 
 * A heading, which is a short (up to 255-character long) piece of text that summarizes the posting. The heading is optional.
 * 
 * Some body text, which can be up to 5,000 characters long. This can contain any text you like.
 * 
 * A price, which is the price associated with this posting, if any.
 * 
 * A currency, which is a three-letter code identifying which currency the price is in. Note that the currency code must conform to the ISO 4217 standard.
 * 
 * A posting key, which is an eight-character string that uniquely identifies this posting within the 3taps system.
 * 
 * An optional password which an anonymous user can enter to identify themselves as the author of a posting.
 * 
 * One ore more optional images.
 * 
 * An optional external URL which links back to the original source of the posting.
 * 
 * An optional account name which identifies the author of the posting in the originating system.
 * 
 * The 3taps user ID of the person who made this posting, if it is known.
 * 
 * A timestamp indicating the date and time at which this posting was made.
 * 
 * An expiration date/time indicating when the posting should be deleted from the 3taps system.
 * 
 * An external ID, which is simply a piece of text which can be used to find the original posting in some external system. The 3taps network simply stores this value if it has been provided, and does not use this information in any way.
 * 
 * A set of annotations providing additional meta-data about this posting. The annotations can be any data structure encoded using the JSON format. Note that these annotations can come from an untrusted source.
 * 
 * A set of trustedAnnotations which provide additional "trusted" meta-data about this posting. As with the annotations, the trusted annotations are a JSON-encoded string containing any arbitrary data structure. The trusted annotations can only come from 3taps or some other authorised source.
 * 
 * The rawData, which is simply some text or binary data copied directly from an external system.

For example, if a posting has been "sent" to the Posting API by an external source, that external source can optionally send a status of "sent" the Status API. Once the Posting API has processed and saved the posting, it can send the status of "saved" to the Status API. Later, if somebody looks up the posting in the Status API, they will see both of these events (sent and saved), along with the time that they occurred, and any relevant attributes (postKey, errors, etc). Having this information allows 3taps and sources to provide maximum visibility into their processes so that both can improve data yield.
